# YouTube PubSubHubbub Service Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the YouTube PubSubHubbub Service, a microservice designed to handle real-time notifications from YouTube when new content is published.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Subscription Verification**
   - The service must handle YouTube's subscription verification requests via GET endpoints
   - Must properly respond to hub.challenge parameter for subscription confirmation

2. **Content Notifications**
   - Must process POST notifications when new videos are published
   - Must parse YouTube's Atom XML feed format
   - Must extract video title, channel name, and video ID from notifications
   - Must log the title of newly published videos

3. **Endpoints**
   - Must provide a home page endpoint (`GET /`)
   - Must provide a PubSubHubbub endpoint for subscription verification (`GET /pubsub/youtube`)
   - Must provide a PubSubHubbub endpoint for content notifications (`POST /pubsub/youtube`)

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
1. **Response Time**
   - Must respond to verification requests within acceptable timeframe (YouTube expects quick responses)
   - Must process notifications efficiently to handle potential high volume

### Reliability
1. **Error Handling**
   - Must implement proper error handling for malformed requests
   - Must log errors appropriately for debugging
   - Must return appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

### Security
1. **Input Validation**
   - Must validate incoming requests to prevent security vulnerabilities
   - Should consider implementing request authentication if needed in the future

### Scalability
1. **Load Handling**
   - Should be able to handle multiple concurrent requests
   - Should be designed to scale horizontally if needed

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
1. **Framework**
   - Must be built using the Ktor framework
   - Must use Kotlin as the programming language

2. **XML Processing**
   - Must use Jackson for XML parsing
   - Must handle the Atom XML format used by YouTube

### Operational Constraints
1. **Deployment**
   - Must be deployable as a standalone service
   - Must be accessible via a public URL for YouTube to send notifications

## Future Considerations
1. **Enhanced Notification Processing**
   - May need to store notifications in a database
   - May need to implement more sophisticated processing of video metadata

2. **Integration**
   - May need to integrate with other services or APIs
   - May need to forward notifications to other systems

3. **Authentication**
   - May need to implement authentication for the API
   - May need to implement signature validation for YouTube notifications
