# Horizontal Scaling Design for YouTube PubSubHubbub Service

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive design for horizontally scaling the YouTube PubSubHubbub Service. The design addresses the key components that need to be scaled and provides a solution that ensures reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Current Architecture Assessment

The current architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Application Service**: A Kotlin/Ktor application that handles subscription verification and content notifications.
2. **Database**: An H2 file-based database for storing subscription data.
3. **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for queueing notifications for processing.
4. **Cache**: In-memory Ehcache for caching frequently accessed data.

### Identified Scaling Challenges

1. **Stateful Components**:
   - H2 Database: File-based and not designed for horizontal scaling
   - Ehcache: In-memory cache, not distributed, leading to cache inconsistency across instances

2. **Potential Bottlenecks**:
   - Database access
   - Cache synchronization
   - Message queue throughput

## Horizontal Scaling Design

### 1. Application Layer Scaling

#### Design Approach
- Deploy multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer
- Ensure the application is stateless by externalizing all state to shared services
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and automatic scaling

#### Implementation Details
- Update the application to be fully stateless
- Configure health checks for load balancer and Kubernetes
- Implement graceful shutdown to handle in-flight requests

### 2. Database Scaling

#### Design Approach
- Replace H2 with a horizontally scalable database solution
- Options:
  - PostgreSQL with read replicas for read-heavy workloads
  - Distributed database like Amazon Aurora or Google Cloud Spanner for high availability

#### Implementation Details
- Migrate schema from H2 to PostgreSQL
- Update database connection configuration to use connection pooling
- Implement database-specific optimizations (indexes, query tuning)
- Configure read/write splitting if using read replicas

### 3. Caching Strategy

#### Design Approach
- Replace in-memory Ehcache with a distributed caching solution
- Options:
  - Redis for simple distributed caching
  - Redis Cluster for higher availability and scalability

#### Implementation Details
- Update CacheService to use Redis instead of Ehcache
- Implement appropriate serialization/deserialization for cached objects
- Configure cache eviction policies and TTLs
- Set up Redis Sentinel or Cluster for high availability

### 4. Message Queue Scaling

#### Design Approach
- Scale RabbitMQ to handle increased message throughput
- Options:
  - RabbitMQ Cluster for high availability and throughput
  - Consider alternatives like Kafka for extremely high volume

#### Implementation Details
- Configure RabbitMQ clustering
- Implement consumer-side load balancing with prefetch count
- Set up message persistence and acknowledgment for reliability
- Configure dead letter queues for failed message handling

### 5. Load Balancing

#### Design Approach
- Implement load balancing to distribute traffic across application instances
- Options:
  - Kubernetes Service with ClusterIP
  - Cloud provider load balancer (AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancer)
  - Nginx or HAProxy for on-premises deployment

#### Implementation Details
- Configure health checks and circuit breakers
- Implement session affinity if needed
- Set up SSL termination at the load balancer
- Configure appropriate timeouts and connection limits
